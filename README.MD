**Directions for Generating the Tidy Data Set**

1. Download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
2. Unzip the data and place the script run_analysis.R in the same directory as the unzipped data, but not in the unzipped data folder.
3. Set the R working directory to the location of run_analysis.R.
4. Run the script run_analysis.R. The script will write a file called final_stats.txt, which contains the final tidy data set.
5. To view the final data set in R, look at the matrix final_stats.
